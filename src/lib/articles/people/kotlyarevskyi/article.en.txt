# Ivan Kotlyarevskyi (1769-1838)

Ivan Kotlyarevskyi's poem Aeneid is the first work written in the Poltava dialect, which became the basis for the formation of the Ukrainian literary language. In the Aeneid, ancient heroes are depicted as Cossacks, which contributed to the poem's wide popularity.
In 1796, the writer, who graduated from the theological seminary and was a home teacher, joined the Siversky Carabinieri Regiment. Then he takes part in the Russian-Turkish war, and during Napoleon's campaign in Russia, he was assigned to form the 5th Ukrainian Cossack Regiment, for which he received the rank of major.
Moreover, Kotlyarevsky set a condition that this unit would remain a permanent Ukrainian military formation after the war. However, the condition was not fulfilled.
Later, Kotlyarevsky managed the Poltava Free Theater and even wrote for it the play Natalka Poltavka and the vaudeville Moskal the Magician, which marked the beginning of the Ukrainian musical and dramatic theater.
