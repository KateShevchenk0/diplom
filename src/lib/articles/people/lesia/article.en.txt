# Lesya Ukrainka (1871-1913)

Ivan Franko once called Lesya Ukrainka the only man in all of Ukraine, noting that she has no equal among contemporary domestic poets. The classic did not exaggerate. Lesya Ukrainka, who was given only 42 years of life by fate, enriched Ukrainian poetry with the absolute perfection of form, a variety of universal themes and a multitude of poetic genres.
Her dramatic poems (Kaminnyi hospodar, Oderzhyma, Cassandra and others) are staged again and again on domestic theater stages, and the famous drama-extravaganza Forest Song gave Ukraine a whole cultural stratum - based on its motifs, a ballet and many theatrical versions were staged, and several screen adaptations were made.
Despite a serious illness - bone tuberculosis - the poetess was distinguished by her enormous capacity for work and strength of spirit, which became one of the main motives of her lyrics. Lesya Ukrainka spoke several languages and was one of the best translators in Ukrainian literature: she translated Heinrich Heine, Adam Mickiewicz, Victor Hugo, Homer and other world classics.
