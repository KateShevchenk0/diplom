# Taras Shevchenko (1814-1861)

Taras Shevchenko's name has become a symbol of freedom for many generations of Ukrainians, his philosophy is a national idea, and his works are a mandatory part of humanitarian education. Literary experts equate his poetry collection Kobzar with the Gospel in terms of significance for his compatriots.

Many songs based on Shevchenko's poems have become popular, among them Reve and moans the Dnieper is wide, which in Soviet times was considered an informal national anthem. Shevchenko also created a poetic interpretation of the history of Ukraine: in verse and prose he wrote many works about the real life of his contemporaries.

The great Ukrainian poet left his homeland at the age of 15, spoke Russian most of his life, and returned to Ukraine only for a short time - 2.5 years. He graduated from the Art Academy in St. Petersburg and became famous in the Russian Empire as a painter and graphic artist.

At that time, Shevchenko was a serf, and St. Petersburg artist Karl Bryullov together with writer Vasyl Zhukovsky organized a lottery, the funds from which allowed Shevchenko to gain his freedom.
