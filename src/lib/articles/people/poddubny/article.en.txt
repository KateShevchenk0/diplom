# Ivan Poddubny (1871-1949)

Ivan Piddubny, a descendant of Zaporozhian Cossacks, made his ancestors famous all over the world. A legendary strongman, the first six-time world champion in Greco-Roman wrestling, he became famous as a phenomenal athlete and did not lose a single tournament in his life, although he finished his performances at the age of 70.
Both on the wrestling carpet, and in the circus arena, and during personal tours, Piddubny was a huge success with the public. The Ukrainian strongman, who defeated the world's strongest wrestlers, conquered four continents and more than fifty cities, including in the USA and Western Europe.
By the way, when in the USSR he was issued a passport with the nationality "Russian" and a surname written in Russian, the athlete, who was born in the Poltava region, changed his data in the document to "Piddubny" and "Ukrainian" by his own hand.
