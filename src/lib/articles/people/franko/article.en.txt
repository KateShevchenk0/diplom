# Ivan Franko (1856-1916)

For Ukrainian culture, which for a long time developed not thanks to, but against, Ivan Franko became an unprecedented iconic figure. A talented poet, prose writer and playwright who almost won the Nobel Prize for literature, Franko, in fact, created a Ukrainian analogue of Balzac's Human Comedy â€” he depicted the Ukraine of his time in a whole series of socio-psychological works. Also, many of his poetic works became programmatic for supporters of independent Ukraine. And Frank's historical prose is classified as a national classic of the first echelon.
Proficient in many languages, he translated dozens of examples of world literary classics into Ukrainian, and many of them received a Ukrainian translation for the first time: from Homer, Dante and Shakespeare to Goethe, Mickiewicz and Zola. As an ethnographer, Franko organized tons of folklore, published a number of the most important works on the theory of literature, history, economy of Ukraine, and philosophy, and was one of the leading publicists of his time.
The Franco-politician stood at the origins of the first Ukrainian parties, insisting on expanding the political rights of Ukrainians and their culture - no wonder he was arrested three times in his youth. Contrary to the opinion of many Galician Ukrainians, the writer insisted on the unity of all Ukrainian lands and urged not to divide Ukrainians into "Galicians" or "Bukovinians".
