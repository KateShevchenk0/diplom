# Les Kurbas (1887-1937)

Les Kurbas became famous as an innovative director and creator of experimental theater. His artistic ideas were picked up by many directors in different cities of Ukraine, as well as in Moscow.
Kurbas was born into a poor acting family in Sambor, but received a brilliant education, studying philosophy at the universities of Lviv and Vienna.
He first appeared on stage at the Hnat Hotkevich Theater in Krasnopil (now Ivano-Frankivsk region). And in 1917, with the formation of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Kurbas was invited to Kyiv, where he first created the Young Theater, and later the Berezil Theater. In the early 1920s, his troupe toured many cities of Central Ukraine.
At the peak of Berezol's heyday, his troupe consisted of 400 actors, and the theater had six studios. There was a psychological laboratory here, which developed new methods of work for actors and directors. Kurbas demanded deep erudition and an intellectual approach to the roles from the actors.
Playwright Mykola Kulish worked closely with the Kurbas Theater. Over time, the productions of his plays caused displeasure of the authorities. Kurbas was accused of nationalism and sentenced to five years in the camps. In 1937, he was shot in Solovki.
