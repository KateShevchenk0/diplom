# Mykola Lysenko (1842-1912)

The operas Natalka Poltavka and Taras Bulba, written by Mykola Lysenko, have not left the stages of Ukrainian theaters for a century and a half, and their author is the founder of Ukrainian opera and symphonic music.
Although Lysenko graduated from the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Kyiv University, thanks to his abilities as a virtuoso pianist, he made a career as a musician. However, he received a musical education in Leipzig, and studied opera in St. Petersburg with Rimsky-Korsakov.
The composer was a member of cultural and educational organizations that promoted Ukrainian culture at home and in Europe. During his trips abroad, he gave concerts, performing his own arrangements of folk songs. Critics at the time compared his style of playing to such virtuosos as Ferenc Liszt and Frederic Chopin.
In 1872, when the first performance of the Ukrainian musical theater took place in Kyiv, the opera Chornomortsi, the music for which was written by Lysenko, was chosen for the premiere.
