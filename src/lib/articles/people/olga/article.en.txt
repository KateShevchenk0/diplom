# Princess Olga (c. 920-969)

After the death of her husband, Prince Igor, Olga became the first woman to rule the Old Russian state. She pursued a harsh policy towards the tribes that obeyed Kiev. The history of Olga's massacre of the Drevlian nobility is known from the annals - Igor was killed in the lands of this tribe during the collection of tribute. After that, by order of the princess, the fiscal system at that time was improved: strongholds for collecting tribute - pogostas - were built throughout the state.

In 957, the princess made a diplomatic mission to Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium. There she met with Emperor Constantine and signed an agreement - obviously a trade agreement. Having stayed in Byzantium for more than six months, Olga was absorbed by the achievements of the strongest Christian state at that time. In the same year, she accepted Christianity, but she failed to spread the new religion in her homeland.
