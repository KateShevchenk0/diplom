# Danylo Halytskyi (1201-1264)

During the fragmentation of the Old Russian state, Prince Danylo was the most successful ruler on the lands of modern Ukraine. His reign coincided with dramatic events - the Mongol-Tatar invasion. Danilov had to conduct a subtle policy in order to save his lands from complete ruin. He made a long trip to Khan Batia's pond, where he received guarantees of the security of the Galicia-Volyn state.
In 1253, Danylo Halytskyi, who was looking for military and political support in the West, received a royal title from the Pope.
During his reign, he founded a number of cities on his lands that still exist today. Among them are Kholm (now Chelm in Poland) and Lviv.
