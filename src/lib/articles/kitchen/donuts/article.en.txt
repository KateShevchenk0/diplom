# Donuts

Pampushki is a popular Ukrainian dish that is considered a sweet addition to borscht or other dishes. They are shaped like soft and fluffy balls with a sweet filling inside.
Dumplings are usually made from yeast dough, which has a fresh and aromatic taste. To prepare the dough, flour, yeast, sugar, milk or water, eggs, salt and melted butter are mixed. The dough is then left to rise for a certain amount of time so that it rises.
When preparing donuts, form small balls from the risen dough and make a small hole in the center of each ball. This pit is filled with a sweet filling such as jam, boiled milk or sugar syrup. After that, the donuts are baked in the oven until golden.
Ready-made donuts can be sprinkled with powdered sugar or sprinkled with glaze for an additional sweet taste. They have a delicate texture and a sweet aroma, which makes them a wonderful addition to any table.
