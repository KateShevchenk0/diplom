# Golubtsi

Golubtsi is a traditional Ukrainian dish that is used in many cuisines around the world. It consists of cabbage, which is stuffed with minced meat and boiled or baked in the oven until done.
Cooking cabbage rolls begins with the preparation of cabbage. Sauerkraut or fresh white cabbage is often used. Cabbage is peeled from the upper leaves, and then boiled or sprinkled with boiling water so that the leaves become soft and flexible.
Next, the filling for cabbage rolls is prepared, which can contain various ingredients. Traditionally, minced meat from beef or pork is used, which is mixed with a frying pan, rice, onions and spices. Sometimes mushrooms, vegetables or cheese are also added to the filling.
After preparing the cabbage and filling, form cabbage rolls. To do this, put a portion of the filling on each leaf of cabbage and carefully twist all the edges. Doves are placed in a pan or baking dish, sauce is added (often it can be tomato sauce or sour cream) and boiled or baked in the oven until done.
