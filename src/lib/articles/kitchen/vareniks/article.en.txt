# Vareniks

Varenyki is one of the most famous and favorite dishes of Ukrainian cuisine. They are delicate cakes that are filled with various fillings and then boiled or fried until done. Varenyki have a rich history and deep roots in Ukrainian culture.
Traditionally, dumplings are made from a dough made from flour, eggs, water and salt. But other ingredients can be used, such as milk or sour milk, to obtain more delicate cakes. Fillings for dumplings can be various: potatoes, cheese, berries, mushrooms, meat, dried fruits, etc. Each filling has its own unique taste and gives the dumplings their own special atmosphere.
Dumplings are usually prepared in a large amount of water, boiled until they become soft and springy. After that, the dumplings are removed from the water and served with butter, sour cream or sauce, and can also be decorated with fresh herbs, berries or powdered sugar.
