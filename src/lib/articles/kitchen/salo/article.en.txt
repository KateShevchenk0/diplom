# Salo

Salo is one of the most famous and favorite dishes in Ukrainian cuisine. This is a traditional product that has deep roots in Ukrainian culture and is a symbol of the national gastronomic heritage.
Lard is pork fat that has a white or pink color and a soft texture. Ukrainians use different types of lard, such as wallpaper, back, ham, side, to prepare various dishes and as an independent product.
One of the most popular ways of using lard is making lard "with skin". For this, a piece of pork fat is cut into thin plates or cubes, keeping the skin. This fat is then salted and smoked, which gives it a characteristic aroma and taste.
Lard can be used as an independent dish, cut into thin pieces or cubes. It can also be used in the preparation of other dishes, for example, added to borscht, soups, fried in a pan or used for salting meat dishes.
