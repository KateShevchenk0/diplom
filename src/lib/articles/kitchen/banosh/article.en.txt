# Banosh

Banosh is a traditional Ukrainian dish originating from the Carpathian region. This is a hearty corn porridge made from corn flour and other natural ingredients.
Preparing banoche is quite simple. First, corn flour is mixed with hot water and salt. The dough is mixed until it becomes a homogeneous mass. Then it is formed into a ball or a rectangular plate and boiled in boiling water until ready. When the banoche is ready, it is cut into pieces or cubes.
Banosh can be served as an independent dish or as a side dish to meat or mushroom dishes. It is often decorated with melted butter or sour cream, which adds a lot of flavor. Banoche can also be fried in a pan with the addition of butter to get a crispy outer crust.
