# Borscht

Borsch is one of the most famous dishes of Ukrainian cuisine and a symbol of national culture. This hearty and aromatic dish has a long history and is recognized as an integral part of the Ukrainian table.
Traditional Ukrainian borscht is made from fresh vegetables such as beets, potatoes, carrots, onions, cabbage and tomatoes. The basis of borscht is broth, which can be meat, fish or vegetable. Meat broth is often made from beef or pork, and fish broth is made from fresh fish, such as crucian carp or perch. Vegetable broth is prepared on the basis of water, but gives borscht a delicate taste palette.
Beets are a key ingredient in Ukrainian borscht. They give the dish a rich red color and a unique taste. Borscht can be prepared in variations with meat, mushrooms, cabbage or vegetarian.
