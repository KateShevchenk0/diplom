# Shrovetide

Shrovetide is one of the funnest and most joyous holidays in Ukrainian culture. It is celebrated a week before Easter and is considered the last week before Lent.
The main feature of Shrovetide is the consumption of oily dishes, in particular pancakes. Pancakes symbolize the sun and the arrival of spring. During the celebration of Shrovetide, large mountains of pancakes with various fillings and sauces are decorated on the hostesses' tables. People together with family and friends fry, serve and eat pancakes in a cheerful company.

On the streets you can see carnival characters dressed in bright costumes and masks, symbolizing the banishment of winter and the upcoming arrival of spring.
