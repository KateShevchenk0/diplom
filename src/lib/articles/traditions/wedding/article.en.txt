# Wedding traditions

Wedding traditions in Ukraine are an important part of culture and national heritage. A wedding in Ukraine is a special holiday, which is accompanied by numerous rites and customs that are passed down from generation to generation.
One of the most famous elements of Ukrainian wedding traditions is the "splash" that takes place at the beginning of the wedding ceremony. The young man and the young woman dance Ukrainian folk dances together to the music, while the guests shower them with money, which symbolizes the wish for a happy and prosperous marriage.
Also, an important part of wedding traditions are embroidered wedding shirts worn by young people. These shirts are decorated with luxurious embroidery that symbolizes beauty, happiness and long married life. Embroidered shirts can have different ornaments, depending on the region where the wedding is held.
