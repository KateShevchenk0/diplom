# Easter

Easter is one of the most important religious holidays of the Ukrainian people. It is a symbol of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and marks the end of Great Lent. Easter is a time of joy, hope and community as families and friends come together to celebrate.
Easter traditions in Ukraine have deep roots and are connected with religious rites and folk customs. One of the most famous symbols of Easter are pysanky - Easter eggs, which are painted with unique ornaments and symbols. Easter eggs symbolize new life, rebirth and fertility.
Another important Easter tradition is the festive Easter basket, which is prepared on the Saturday before Easter. The basket is filled with various dishes that have their own special meaning. For example, paska is a special type of holiday bread, symbolizing Christ's resurrection. The basket can also contain sausage, eggs, butter, horseradish, greens and other products.
