# Pysankarstvo

Pysankarstvo is a unique Ukrainian art of painting Easter eggs - eggs. This is an ancient traditional craft that is passed down from generation to generation and is an integral part of Ukrainian folk culture.
Pysanky are Easter eggs that have a special ornament and symbolism. Easter eggs are painted using wax and special colors. Before starting work, the craftsman heats the wax in a wax pot and applies it to the egg with a special tool - a brush called a pen. The wax creates a protective layer on the egg that prevents the paint from penetrating.
After applying the wax, the egg is immersed in paint, which colors only the areas not covered with wax. After that, the process is repeated - wax is applied to new areas, and the egg is again immersed in paint, and so on. The color and ornament of the Easter egg is formed in stages, and after the painting is finished, the wax is fired, and the Easter egg is treated with linseed oil or varnish to give it shine and durability.
