# Christmas

Kolyada is one of the oldest and most beloved folk holidays in Ukraine, which is celebrated from January 7 to 19. This holiday is associated with the arrival of the new year and the winter solstice. The Christmas carol symbolizes the rebirth of nature, health and prosperity.
The main element of the Christmas celebration is caroling. Young people and children in folk costumes go from house to house, singing carols and giving gifts. They wish good, happiness and prosperity to their owners, and accordingly receive gifts, food and money. Caroling is a kind of ritual that brings joy and unites the community.
In addition to caroling, the traditions of Kolyada also include coloring carols. Young people paint folk symbols and images on boards or paper, which are then put on display in village houses. It is considered a peculiar form of creative self-expression and commemoration of folk culture.
