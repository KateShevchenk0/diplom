# Sophia of Kyiv

Hagia Sophia, also known as St. Sophia's Cathedral, is one of the most remarkable monuments of Ukraine and one of the oldest stone buildings in Kyiv. It is located in the historical center of the city and is a symbol of the cultural heritage of Kyivan Rus.
The cathedral was built in the 11th century and served as the main church of Kyivan Rus. Its architectural style combines the influences of Byzantine and Kyivan architectural traditions. The exterior of the cathedral impresses with its majesty and luxury of details, such as golden domes, mosaics and exquisite paintings.
Priceless relics and artistic treasures are kept inside the Saint Sophia of Kyiv. The main architectural element in the middle of the cathedral is a magnificent mosaic vault, which is decorated with images of biblical scenes and saints. It is also worth paying attention to the large collection of ancient icons painted by famous Kyiv masters.
