Russian aggression against Ukraine led to the terrible destruction of numerous significant monuments. Among them, we can name the Hagia Sophia in Kyiv, which is an unsurpassed masterpiece of ancient architecture and a UNESCO world heritage. During the Russian invasion, Hagia Sophia was badly damaged, its interior and icons suffered extensive damage, and its walls and domes were gutted by shelling.
