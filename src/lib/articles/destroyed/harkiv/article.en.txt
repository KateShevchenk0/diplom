V. N. Karazin Kharkiv National University is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in Ukraine. Founded in 1804, it became a cultural and scientific center that influenced many generations of scientists and students.
Karazin University has a rich history and is famous for its academic achievements. It offers a wide range of educational programs in different fields of knowledge, including humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, medicine and many others. The university is a center of scientific research and innovative development, contributing to progress and development in Ukraine.
However, during the Russian aggression in the East of Ukraine, Kharkiv National University named after V. N. Karazin was not left out of attention. University buildings were damaged and destroyed as a result of shelling and military operations. This was a great loss for Ukrainian education and cultural heritage, because Karazin University was a symbol of academic excellence and scientific advancement.
