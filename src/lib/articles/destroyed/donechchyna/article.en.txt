Sviatohirska Lavra (or Holy Dormition Monastery) is an outstanding religious and cultural heritage located in Donetsk region of Ukraine. Founded in the 17th century, the Lavra is an important spiritual center for Orthodox Christians and a point of attraction for believers from all over the world.
Sviatohirska Lavra occupies a large area and includes numerous churches, monastery buildings, museums and other architectural structures. Among them, a special place is occupied by the Assumption Cathedral, which serves as the central sanctuary of the Lavra. This majestic cathedral impresses with its beauty, artistic details and religious significance.
However, during the full-scale Russian invasion of Donetsk region, the Sviatohorsk Lavra suffered significant damage. Destroyed monastic buildings, damaged churches and monastic structures became a silent testimony of the brutality of the enemy's aggression. This destruction of great historical and religious value was a loss for Ukrainian culture and heritage.
