The Shchors Cinema was one of the most famous and popular cultural buildings in Ukraine, located in one of the country's largest cities. Founded way back in 1930, the cinema served as a place of meeting, entertainment and cultural revival for many generations of viewers.
The Shchors Cinema had an impact on the development of cinematography in Ukraine, showing important films by domestic and international directors. It embodied the spirit and national pride of the Ukrainian film industry, performing the function of a center of cultural education and entertainment.
Unfortunately, during the Russian aggression, the Shchors cinema was seriously damaged and destroyed. Due to the violent invasion, the building was destroyed, the ensemble of the historical complex suffered great damage. This was a great loss for Ukrainian cultural heritage, because the Shchors cinema was a symbol of the film industry and cultural life of the country.
