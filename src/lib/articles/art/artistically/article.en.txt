Ukrainian fine art has a rich history and a variety of styles that reflect the uniqueness and beauty of Ukrainian culture. It includes various forms of expression, such as painting, sculpture, graphics, folk art and modern fine art.
The Ukrainian painting school has its roots in icon painting, but has developed into a separate creative branch with unique artistic means of expression. Famous Ukrainian artists, such as Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Aivazovsky, Mykhailo Vrubel, Oleksandr Murashko and many others, created masterpieces that reflect Ukrainian nature, landscapes, portraits, historical and folklore subjects.
Ukrainian sculpture reflects a variety of styles and techniques. From ancient Russian stone reliefs to modern sculptural compositions, Ukrainian sculptors embody their ideas and feelings in three-dimensional forms. The famous Ukrainian sculptor Mykola Lysenko created such famous works as "Motherland" in Kyiv and "Taras Shevchenko" in Lviv.
