# Ukrainian music

Ukrainian music has a long and multifaceted history that reflects the cultural heritage and traditions of the Ukrainian people. It includes a variety of genres, ranging from folk and ethno-folk music to classical, contemporary and experimental music.
Ukrainian folk music is an integral part of the cultural heritage of Ukraine. It conveys folk customs, history, feelings and life philosophy of the Ukrainian people. This includes various forms of singing and music, such as Cossack songs, dumas, carols, chants, ceremonial and wedding songs. Instruments often used in folk music include the bandura, kobza, lyre, pipe, and many others.
Ukrainian classical music has its roots in the traditions of European classical music, but also has unique features that reflect the national flavor. Prominent Ukrainian composers, such as Mykola Lysenko, Serhii Prokofiev, Mykola Vitaliyovych Leontovych and others, created a large number of classical works inspired by Ukrainian folk melodies and traditions.
