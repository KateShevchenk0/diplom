# Ukrainian Theater

Ukrainian theater has a long and multifaceted history, which extends from folk theater traditions to modern professional theater institutions. This art form is an important component of Ukrainian culture and national identity. Here are some key moments and famous theater institutions of Ukrainian theater:
Folk theater traditions: Ukrainian theater has deep roots in folk culture. Ancient ritualistic dramatic rites observed by Ukrainian peasants played an important role in the development of theatrical art. Folk forms of theater, such as "Vertep" and "Carols", which reflected religious and folk traditions, are especially well-known.
Professional theater: Ukrainian professional theater was born in the 19th century under the influence of European theatrical traditions. The famous Ukrainian actor Markiyan Shashkevich founded the first professional Ukrainian theater in Lviv in 1842. Gradually, other theater institutions emerged, in particular the Kyiv Academic Theater of Opera and Ballet named after Taras Shevchenko.
