Epic poems tell about heroic feats of Cossacks and historical events. Lyrical songs reflect feelings of love, separation, and longing for one's homeland. There are also ritual songs that are associated with various holidays and ceremonies, such as weddings, Christmas holidays, Shrovetide and others.
